title: Ultimate From-Scratch Mechanical Keyboard Build Guide
---

#### For those looking to do the least amount of work possible while maximizing ownership

If you're someone who has garnered enough interest in modern mechanical keyboards to want to build your own with a high degree of thoroughness and control but don't necessarily have the domain knowledge to just jump right in, then you've come to the right place. This guide assumes a generally high comfort-level with technology and a desire to learn. It's gonna be kind of a write-up/build-guide hybrid with some examples from the numberpad I recently built.

Buckle up, cause it's a long one.

# Planning Phase
## Layout
First step is to decide the layout you want. If you haven't thought about it enough yet, Keyboard University has a [great guide](https://keyboard.university/guides/what-size-mechanical-keyboard-should-i-get-g7dbr) for exploring the different common sizes and keyboard layouts. There are also unorthodox layouts like [the split keeb](https://kinesis-ergo.com/split-keyboards/) and [ortho linear](https://www.mechkeybs.com/learn/ortholinear-keyboards-guide/).

But that's baby stuff. You're making your own keyboard from scratch. So these common layouts are merely suggestions. Granted, they're very good suggestions, and you should take the time to explore and study what's already been done and what people already like. But if you've got even a little tweak for any of these to make your ideal layout, then that's what you'll want to do.

My build, the [Numpadulator](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/76c01d799a5c22b1c113d56c44afb9e6), was a little numpad layout with some extra stuff above the top row.

### Bells and whistles
Extra features that you may want, such as RGB backlighting, rotary encoders (knobs), OLED display panels, and more, can affect your layout. Thus, you should decide which of these features you want to end up in your build before you get designing.

## Keycaps
Assuming you aren't also making your own keycaps from scratch (which [you](https://uniqey.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008759900-Designing-a-Custom-GMK-Keycap-Set-Guide-) can [do](https://drop.com/talk/475/what-goes-into-creating-a-custom-keycap-set?utm_source=linkshare&referer=5V6HRP)), there are some pretty quick factors you can look at during the search for your desired aesthetic.

Here's a nice little comparison table between the two main types of plastics that keycaps are made from. This comes from a [very good guide](https://switchandclick.com/ultimate-guide-to-picking-a-keycap-set-for-your-mechanical-keyboard/) provided by [switchandclick](https://switchandclick.com/).

| ABS                         | PBT                  |
| --------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Cheaper                     | More expensive       |
| Shiny/Greasy feel over time | Matte, more durable  |
| Smooth                      | Textured             |
| Tend to be thinner          | Tend to be thicker   |
| Quieter, lighter sound      | Louder, deeper sound |

You can decide on the keycaps you want at any point, since you'll very likely end up with MX-style switches so don't fret too much about that.

## Switches
As mentioned, almost all the switches you'll come across are MX-style. That just means they are made using the same profile as the most popular mechanical switch on the market, [Cherry MX](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/Switches/MX%20Series.pdf). These switches are generally divided into three categories: Linear, Tactile, and Clicky. Here's another handy table (it is very generalized, there is a lot of variation on the market nowadays).

| Linear                                                             | Tactile                                                | Clicky                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No feedback on actuation                                           | Noticeable "bump" (point of resistance) upon actuation | Noticeable bump and click upon actuation                                          |
| Quietest, only the sound of the keycap and stem hitting the bottom | Pretty quiet, bump might add a soft plastic-y sound    | Loud, designed to make an audible click, like a mouse button, for every keystroke |
| Easiest to press (best for touch-typists)                          | Varies widely on how easy to press                     | Medium-to-hardest to press                                                        |
| E.g. Cherry MX Red                                                 | E.g. Cherry MX Brown                                   | E.g. Cherry MX Blue                                                               |


You'll hear talk that the switches actually made by Cherry are among the worst in each category. While this is generally the case for someone seeking an excellent, customized typing experience, it's still a deeply personal/subjective stance and you should never feel like your preference is somehow right or wrong :)
