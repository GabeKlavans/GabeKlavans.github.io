title: Ultimate From-Scratch Mechanical Keyboard Build Guide
---

#### For those looking to do the least amount of work possible while maximizing ownership

If you're someone who has garnered enough interest in modern mechanical keyboards to want to build your own with a high degree of thoroughness and control but don't necessarily have the domain knowledge to just jump right in, then you've come to the right place. This guide assumes a generally high comfort-level with technology and a desire to learn. It's gonna be kind of a write-up/build-guide hybrid with some examples from the numberpad I recently built.

Buckle up, cause it's a long one.

## Layout
First step is to decide the layout you want. If you haven't thought about it enough yet, Keyboard University has a [great guide](https://keyboard.university/guides/what-size-mechanical-keyboard-should-i-get-g7dbr) for exploring the different common sizes and keyboard layouts. There are also unorthadox layouts like [the split keeb](https://kinesis-ergo.com/split-keyboards/) and [ortho linear](https://www.mechkeybs.com/learn/ortholinear-keyboards-guide/).

But that's baby stuff. You're making your own keybaord from scratch. So these common layouts are merely suggestions. Granted, they're very good suggestions. But if you've got just a little tweak for any of these to make your idea layout, then that's what you'll want to do.
